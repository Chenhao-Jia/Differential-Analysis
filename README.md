# Diffrential-Analysis
Automatically search the best differential characteristices of DES and PRESENT cipher by Matisui's method. It is not perfect but referential for new learners to implement the automatically searching. The searching algorithm was proposed in Matisui's paper "On correlation between the order of S-boxes and the strength of DES".
